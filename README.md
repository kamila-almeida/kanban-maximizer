# Kanban Project

This Kanban Project is a SPA (Single Page Application) that consumes an API to show the tasks grouped by status with different colors depending on the priority.

## Features

- Angular Framework (v14.1.2)
- Angular Material (v14.2.2)
- Firebase hosting

## Project Execution (cmd)

> Clone this repository

> Access the folder ```kanban-maximizer``` and run 
```npm install``` to install the node packages

> Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Hosting

This is an extra feature. You can also access the application on [https://kanban-maximizer.web.app/](https://kanban-maximizer.web.app/) which is a link generated by the firebase hosting.

## Observations

As this application is simple I made the drag and drop functionality just as a visual demonstration. In a real scenario I would make a request to
the API changing the status when the task was dragged to another column
